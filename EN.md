# ü§î What is this?
This article is an attempt to combine good practices that are useful to keep in mind and apply when developing a backend application.

It can be used as a checklist if:
- You are starting a greenfield project and want to ensure that best practices are used right from the start.
- You received a test assignment and have decided to move forward with it.
 
## ü§î Does this article only cover backend apps? 
Because the author's expertise lies mostly on the backend side, most suggestions will be useful for developing backend apps. However, a lot of the points covered in this article can also be handy for other types of development.

## ü§î There is a lot in here, do I really need all of this?

The more features and practices you adopt in your project, the better. Applying all of them at once would be hard so consider your time üïí and effort üí™ to prioritize specific practices.
## ü§î "This article is missing information about technology X"

If you have a proposal about covering a specific technology here, don't be shy:

# Repository
* Codebase has to live on a public or private Git repository (Github / Gitlab / Bitbucket)
* Repository settings must disable force pushing into (`push --force`) into main branches (`master`, `main`, release branches)
* 'README' should contain:
  - info about the project
  - short summary of tooling and the tech stack
  - instructions for setting up and launching the application
* Use feature branches, pull requests. Refer to this great [article](https://www.flagship.io/git-branching-strategies/) with comparison of different Git Branching Strategies. 
* Use readable commit history. Here is a good set of rules [Conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
* Set up Continuous Integration (Gitlab CI / Github Actions)
* `feature/` and master branches should be set up with:
  * test runners and [coverage](https://www.guru99.com/test-coverage-in-software-testing.html) stats
  * linting  
* Setting up Continuous Delivery - app deployment into different environments (e.g. test/staging/prod) would be a huge plus!
* Optional: Set up [dependabot](https://docs.github.com/ru/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot)

# Code Style
Before development:
* Have a working editor or an IDE:
  * VS Code
  * Visual Studio
  * PyCharm
  * IDEA
  * Vim, emacs
* [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) plugin / add-on is up and running for your editor
* Set up Code formatters: 
  * Rubocop for Ruby
  * Pylint/Black/PEP8 for Python
# ‚úîÔ∏èTests
* Install libraries for writing various test types (unit, integration). For instance: 
   * Pytest for Python
   * RSpec for Ruby
   * Testify, testcontainers for Golang
* Test coverage is calculated automatically after each test run
* Apply [AAA (Arrange Act Assert)](https://medium.com/@pjbgf/title-testing-code-ocd-and-the-aaa-pattern-df453975ab80) pattern when writing unit tests

Try to adhere to the [testing pyramid] (https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html) principle. Note that different test types require different tools. For end-to-end (e2e) testing you can try using [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) or [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/how-it-works/). Integration tests can be added via `testcontainers`.

# ‚öôÔ∏èConfiguration & Infrastructure around Code
* Have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed on your local machine
* There is a Dockerfile in your repository which can be used to build your app into a `Docker container`
  * [Best practices when writing a Dockerfile for a Ruby application](https://lipanski.com/posts/dockerfile-ruby-best-practices) (although, these tips can be useful for other languages)
  * [Google Cloud: Best practices for building containers](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/best-practices-for-building-containers)
* All app dependencies are listed in a `docker-compose.yml` file
* Setting up and launching your application should be as easy and straightforward. It is possible that you may need to write some additional `base/zsh/powershell` scripts
* [Your application should have multiple environments (development, prod, test)](https://12factor.net/dev-prod-parity)
* Use a suitable application server for your `production` environment. For example: 
   * Puma for Ruby
   * Gunicorn3 for Python
   * Undertow for Java

When writing the configuration for your application, use the 12factor principles. The diagram below is copied from the [12 Factor App Revisited](https://architecturenotes.co/12-factor-app-revisited/) article
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abstractart/how-to-develop-perfect-crud/main/12-Factor-app-revised.jpg">

# API Design
* Use the REST](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/rest-api-best-practices-rest-endpoint-design-examples/) architecture conventions as your guiding principle for naming paths, types of operations and API response statuses.
* Response type: JSON (unless otherwise specified)
* There is an option to open Swagger in your repository to familiarize the next developer with your API design
  * It can be written by hand
  * Or you can use a codegen: [rswag (Rails)](https://github.com/rswag/rswag), [safrs (Flask)](https://github.com/thomaxxl/safrs), [echo-swagger (Echo/Golang)](https://github.com/swaggo/echo-swagger)
  
If you think that REST+JSON option is not a great fit for your application design, or your task requires using a different format, it could be beneficial to familiarize yourself with some alternatives:
- [SOAP](https://www.w3.org/TR/soap12-part1/)
- [gRPC](https://grpc.io/)
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)

# Authorization & Authentication
**Authentication** - is a process of verifying a user identity. The most common way to authenticate a user is to compare the password they entered with the password saved in the database.

The following strategies can be used to authenticate API users: 
* HTTP Basic Auth (easy)
* JSON Web Tokens (a bit more complex)

**Authorization** - granting a particular user the rights for performing specific actions. 
For instance: a user who was banned by admin cannot post comments (even though they have been successfully authenticated). 

Some examples of libraries:
- [Pundit for Ruby](https://github.com/varvet/pundit)
- [Casbin (Many languages supported)](https://github.com/casbin/casbin)

# MVC Explanation
Goal: split the responsibilities between components. MVC is a type of architecture that allows a developer to build applications without excessive cognitive load (compared to other web architecture types) 

<img src="https://github.com/abstractart/how-to-develop-perfect-crud/blob/main/mvc-with-service.png?raw=true">

## Controller
- Accepts the request and validates request body based on rules set within your API
- Checks authorization + authentication
- Calls a Service and injects data into it 
- Based on Service return, a controller formats a response and passes it into a View
## Model
* Reflects basic description of schema and relations with other models
* Contains minimum business logic, or ideally none at all
* Is used to make requests to the DB for reads and writes
## Service
* Accepts arguments from controllers and validates the request body
* Uses a Model for reading and writing data to DB.
* Is responsible for the business logic of your application
## View
* Builds an API response based on data passed to it

# üìê‚úèÔ∏èüë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èArchitecture, Design Patterns, Refactoring, etc
After grasping the concept of MVC, try developing a deeper understanding and study:
- different app architecture approaches
- patterns that can make your code future-proof

A few courses that I recommend:
- [Categorized overview of programming principles & design patterns](https://github.com/webpro/programming-principles)
- [Refactoring Patterns and Design Patters Reference](https://refactoring.guru)
- [Summary of "Clean code" by Robert C. Martin](https://gist.github.com/wojteklu/73c6914cc446146b8b533c0988cf8d29)
- [Summary of "Clean Architecture" by Robert C. Martin](https://gist.github.com/ygrenzinger/14812a56b9221c9feca0b3621518635b)

# üîíCRUD: Validations
Before persisting data in the database, one should:
- validate the types (e.g. rows that expect string data types receive string data etc.)
- ensure API request body consistency (if a request contains fields that do not have matching columns in the database, these fields should be ignored)
# CRUD: Database
* Use and ORM (or a similar tool), unless your requirements specify using pure SQL.
  * Easier to operate
  * Safe, because most ORMs offer protection against common SQL vulnerabilities out of the box. 
* Use migrations to create tables and other entities in your DB (Rails Migrations, Flask-Migrate, etc)
* When describing tables, it is important to specify required constraints (NULLABLE, DEFAULT VALUE, UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY)
* When describing tables, it is important to specify indices for columns that are expected to be indexed.
* To protect an API from sequencing attacks, you can try using a `uuid` instead of a `serial`


P.S. Try following the principle of [strong migrations](https://github.com/ankane/strong_migrations) to avoid blocking the DB. 
# CRUD: Operations
## LIST (HTTP GET)
* A response should include ID(s) for every resource.
* Resources should be sorted by some type of attribute such as date of creation.
* An API should support pagination to avoid returning all resources at one. [Database pagination techniques](https://dev.to/appwrite/this-is-why-you-should-use-cursor-pagination-4nh5)
* The number of requests to the database within a single API request must be limited avoiding [the N+1 queries problem](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/97197/what-is-the-n1-selects-problem-in-orm-object-relational-mapping)

An API should not return all the fields for a model.
Example of a response for a list of articles: 
  * ID
  * Title
  * Author name
  * First few sentences of the body

Sending a full text body is really unnecessary.

## READ (HTTP GET)
* Returning resources with all of their fields. Nothing special here.
## CREATE (HTTP POST)
* Filter out fields that should not be accessed by users.
* Commit the INSERT in our DB.
* Send a response with our newly-created resource ID and content. 

Bonus points:
- Make sure that the API endpoint is [idempotent](https://restfulapi.net/idempotent-rest-apis/)
- Set up a rate limiter to protect the database from spam
## UPDATE (HTTP PUT/PATCH)
* Know the difference between PUT and PATCH HTTP methods
* Filter out fields that should not be accessed by users.
* User authorization check
  * Example: users should not be allowed to edit other users' comments.
* Commit the update depending upon the selected HTTP method.

## DESTROY (HTTP DELETE)
* Commit deletion after checking the existing of resource in the database and user authorization

Additionally, you might considering implementing "soft-deletion" (hide deleted resources from users, but keep them in the DB)
# External API Calls, Long-running tasks (And why we need message queue)
If an API needs to:
- send requests to third-party resources
- generate reports or perform long requests to DB 
then it might be a good idea to perform these operations outside of HTTP requests.

To do these operations, we will need a Queue, to which we'll add or remove Tasks.

Examples of high-level libraries that solve the problem of scheduling, reading and processing tasks:
* Celery for Python (tasks are stored in `Redis`)
* Sidekiq for Ruby (tasks are stored in `Redis`)

It is important to note that Redis is not the only option and it might not be suitable for all types of applications. 
Hence, it would be a good idea to learn at least two other advanced libraries for storing and processing queues - `RabbitMG` an d 'Kafka'

# üìàLogs and Metrics
- et up Prometheus metrick with data about the state of HTTP API and application runtime. We recommend using settings that collect application performance metrics using RED (Rate Error Duration)](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3638693/the-red-method-a-new-strategy-for-monitoring-microservices.html) and [USE (Utilization Saturation Errors)](https://www.brendangregg.com/usemethod.html) methodologies:
  - [prometheus, promauto, promhttp for Go](https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/go-application/)
  - [starlette-prometheus for Python](https://github.com/perdy/starlette-prometheus)
- [Logs should only be sent to stdout](https://12factor.net/logs)
- [Logs should have a strict format like JSON](https://coralogix.com/blog/json-logging-why-how-what-tips/)


# üõ°Ô∏èSecurity
- Check library versions you are using for known vulnerabilities. Some utilities that can audit your libraries are:
  - [bundler-audit for Ruby](https://github.com/rubysec/bundler-audit)
  - [pip-audit for Python](https://pypi.org/project/pip-audit/)
  - [local-php-security-checker for PHP](https://github.com/fabpot/local-php-security-checker) or the  `symfony check:security` command, if you are using [Symfony](https://symfony.com/) framework
- Set up dependabot to check and update library versions
- Ensure that the app is protected against common vulnerabilities - [OWASP TOP 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/). Here is a tool that can help with this difficult task [checklist ‚Ññ1](https://github.com/shieldfy/API-Security-Checklist) and [‚Ññ2 (with examples for Ruby on Rails)](https://github.com/brunofacca/zen-rails-security-checklist)
# CORS Headers (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

When dealing with modern single page applications written in popular frameworks like React, Vue.js or Angular, you are likely to encounter a scenario where a client domain will be different from your API domain. In this case, your API will have to include CORS headers to let the browser know that responses coming from the API are permitted.

Typically, a CORS module is already available in your framework of choice and you can use its defaults. If you need more a more granular configuration, here is a few libraries that can help: 
- [Go Echo](https://echo.labstack.com/middleware/cors/)
- [Javascript ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/cors.html)

You can learn more about CORS headers here [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS).

# üöÑCache
First, try to ask yourself
- "Why do I need it? What problem is it going to solve?"
- "Could I do without it?" (for example, by updating the DB schema, adding indices or optimizing etc)

If you are set on implementing caching, then you'll need to:
- Choose the [cache invalidation strategy](https://codeahoy.com/2017/08/11/caching-strategies-and-how-to-choose-the-right-one/) based on:
  - app business logic
  - load profiling (read heavy, write heavy)
  - available resources (implementation of certain strategies can be really complex)
- Choose the size and policy for evicting data (because it is impossible to store all of your data in cache). The most popular choice here is Least Recently Used (LRU).
- Choose the storage:
  - RAM (in app instances)
  - DB (Redis, Memcached, Dynamo, etc)
- Identify the key metrics for measuring the effectiveness (cache hit rate), and be able to change the size or strategy if needed.
